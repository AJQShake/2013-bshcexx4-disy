This folder contains the outline, but incomplete, solution for assessment 3. The
majority of the CORBA plumming is provided as worked through in class.

The servant skeleton is provided but requires more work. You need to implement
a memory-based datastructure to hold the customer records and be able to
retrieve and update these based on calls from client-side code

Skeleton client code is also provided. You are free to implement the client
side any way you like. In the examples, there is a separate command-line
interface to each of the exposed servant interfaces. But you could also
implement this as a single client with a menu or command interface inside it.
